To boost their SEO, We Buy Exotics wanted to create serveral microsites, each emphasizing that they buy a particular kind of luxury vehicle. We started with just the Ferrari and Lamborghini sites. My responsibility was to design the microsites in a way that looked distinct from We Buy Exotics' main primary branding, while appearing slick, inviting, and trustworthy, as you would want a luxury car buyer to be. While the sites needed to be distinct from the main We Buy Exotics site, they did not need to be as distinct from each other, so we were able to use the same site design for all the microsites, with a unique accent color for each. I designed the site with easy access to the contact form at the top of the page, as well as call to action buttons dispersed throughout each page that make it easy for the user to request a quote whenever they're ready. 

Once the designs were approved for development, I was also responsible for building each of these sites in Wordpress using the Avada theme, as well as the css styles.
