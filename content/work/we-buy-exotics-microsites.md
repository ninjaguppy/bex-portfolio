# We Buy Exotics Microsites
<div class="subtitle">Design and Frontend Wordpress Development</div>

As part of their SEO strategy, We Buy Exotics wanted to create serveral microsites, each emphasizing that they buy a particular make of luxury vehicle. We started with the Ferrari and Lamborghini sites. My responsibility was to design the microsites in a way that looked distinct from We Buy Exotics' primary branding, while appearing refined, inviting, and trustworthy, as you would want a luxury car buyer to be. While the sites needed to be distinct from the main We Buy Exotics site, they did not need to be as distinct from each other, so we were able to use the same site design for all the microsites with a unique accent color for each. I designed the site with easy access to the contact form at the top of the page, as well as call to action buttons dispersed throughout each page that make it easy for the user to request a quote whenever they're ready. 

Once the designs were approved for development, I was also responsible for building each of these sites in Wordpress using the Avada theme, as well as writing the css styles.

## Project Goals
The aim of this project was to create a series of micro-sites to boost We Buy Exoticâ€™s SEO. Each site would target a separate customer base of owners of a particular make of luxury car who are looking to sell or lease their car. We Buy Exotics wanted the sites to look similar to each other, but distinct from the main We Buy Exotics site. To test the effectiveness of the campaign, we started with just the Ferrari and Lamborghini sites, with the plan to create more targeting owners of each kind of luxury vehicle if the results were significant.

## Design
I designed the micro sites to have a luxury feel. Various layout treatments keep the content engaging. The CTA form is at or near the top on every relevant page, and each page is abundantly laden with CTA buttons that direct the user to the "request a quote" form for easy and convenient access, no matter when on the user's journey through the site they decide to take action.
