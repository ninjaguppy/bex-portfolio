# G5 Website Redesign
<div class="subtitle">2023, at Studio 2108</div>

G5 is a medical massage therapy machine producer who has been in the business for more than 50 years and is now a gold standard in the massage therapy industry. Used by professional athletes, physical therapists, and patients, G5 is known as a realiable producer of medical devices. However, G5's website, which hadn't been updated in nearly fifteen years when they came to us and was running on outdated web technology that made it difficult for them to edit the site's content, did not match the caliber of their reputation. Furthermore, G5 was looking to redirect their website from being only B2B sales to also being inviting as a B2C experience. The brand needed a lift that would communicate their well-earned place in the world of modern medical technology, while simultaneously representing their identity as a long-standing, trustworthy, established brand, and being inviting enough for the average individual consumer.

All design and graphics for this site are my work. Photography was provided by the client. The site was developed by team members at Studio 2108.

## The Original Site:
The old G5 site, which hadn’t been redesigned since 2008, had some major problems. The menu was inconsistent page-to-page. The site, rather than having a responsive design, was a static width that was too small for today’s browser sizes and too wide for mobile devices.

My task was to give the site a whole new look and a new, responsive, user-friendly design that would help G5 in their shift toward B2C sales, while our marketing partners developed new content for the site.

## The new site:

### Background Graphics

After a visit to the G5 warehouse to try out a few of their machines, I designed the background graphics as a visual representation of the vibration patterns the machines use for massage.

### Images

The client needed the new site fast for a showcase that was coming up. There was no time to take new photography, so I spruced up some old photos they were able to provide with so we could use them for the site. The result was decades old photography used in a modern way, simultaneously communicating the company's age and reliability and their relevance in the contemporary technological sphere. 

I took care in handling product photography, as G5's products were the entire purpose of the site. To bring attention to the devices, I created graphics that draw the eye inward to the product and add interest.
