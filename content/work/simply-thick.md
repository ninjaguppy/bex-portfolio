Simply Thick came to us for a website to advertise their new cookbook, *Modern Dysphagia Cooking*.  They wanted a website that was playful and highlighted the food photography from their recipes, communicating that cooking for Dysphagia can be tasty and fun. I used graphics and color treatments that are reminiscent of the cookbook's design itself to create a fun, image-prominant site that matches the book's branding.
