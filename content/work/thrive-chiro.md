Thrive for Life Chiropractic came to us wanting a redesign of their website and a refresh to their branding in general. They wanted a look that felt life-giving, organic, and fun. I designed a site with colorful graphics that guide the user's eye in curves down the page, interspersed with playful leaves that echo the tree in Thrive's logo.

I also designed print materials including an envelop and gift certificate.
