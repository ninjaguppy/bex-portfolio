# Thrive for Live Chiropractic
<div class="subtitle">Website Redesign, Stationery</div>

Thrive for Life Chiropractic came to us wanting a redesign of their website and a refresh to their branding in general. They wanted a look that felt life-giving, organic, and fun. I designed a site with colorful graphics that guide the user's eye in organic curves down the page, interspersed with playful scatterings of leaves to echo the tree in Thrive's logo.

I also designed print materials including an envelop and gift certificate.
