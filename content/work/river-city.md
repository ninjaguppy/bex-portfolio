# River City Football Club
<div class="subtitle">Landing Page</div>

River City Football Club decided to run a marketing campaign to get the word out about their 2022 season tryouts. My responsibility was to design a landing page and social media ads that matched their existing branding and conveyed the exciting, high caliber persona they wanted to present. I went with a duotone color treatment using their light and dark blue brand colors, which I applied to the photography (which was provided by the client) as well as the landing page's colors. The call to action buttons are always visible in a sticky footer that invites the user to register for tryouts at any point as they scroll through the landing page.

## Project Goals
The purpose of this project was to create a landing page as a destination for a marketing campaign for River City FCâ€™s soccer tryouts. The landing page needed to provide information about River City FC, their teams, and make it easy for parents of players to sign their children up for tryouts.  

## Design
The CTA button is sticky to the bottom of the browser, so users can easily access it whenever they are ready. For an impressive hero photo, I recolored an image from a River City FC soccer game with a duotone treatment of River City FC's light blue and dark blue brand colors. I used those same brand colors throughout the page for typography and other design elements.
