# River City Football Club
<div class="subtitle">Landing Page</div>

River City Football Club decided to run a marketing campaign to get the word out about their 2022 season tryouts. My responsibility was to design a landing page and social media ads that matched their existing branding and conveyed the exciting, high caliber persona they wanted to present. I went with a duotone color treatment using their light and dark blue brand colors, which I applied to the photography (which was provided by the client) as well as the landing page's colors. The call to action buttons are always visible in a sticky footer that invites the user to register for tryouts at any point as they scroll through the landing page.
