# About Me

I'm a designer based  in St. Louis, Missouri. 

I graduated from Truman State University with departmental honors in 2020.
Shortly after, I started working as a Web/Graphic **[Would it be better to pick
one here?]** Designer at Studio 2108. I've worked with all kinds of businesses in the St. Louis region and beyond.
